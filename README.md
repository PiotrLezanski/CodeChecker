# CodeChecker

## Idea
App to compare, analyze and test C++ programms (int the future also Java). Mostly for people that does not feel cofident int Bash.
  
## Applications
#### 1. Get output
After importing C++ file and .in file, CodeChecker returns preview of .out file with possibility to save it locally.

#### 2. Compare two programs (in progress)
After importing two C++ files and .py file that will generate test cases, CodeChecker test both programms and give feedback about differences.
